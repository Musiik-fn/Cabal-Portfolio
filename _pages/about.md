As an experienced IT Project Coordinator, I excel in streamlining operations and enhancing workflows through strategic use of data insights while adhering to PMI methodologies. Proficient in Microsoft Suite and CRM platforms, and backed by a mathematics degree from CSUN and an ongoing Master of Science in Business Analytics, I bring effective project management, sharp data visualization, and articulate technical communication. My track record in managing diverse IT projects and fostering strong stakeholder relationships underscores my dedication to efficiency and progress.

Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about music and arts. As a multi-instrumentalist practicing guitar, violin, theremin, and the otamatone, I enjoy exploring a range of musical genres from classical to contemporary pop. Photography and videography are also key interests, allowing me to delve into creative expression. These artistic endeavors not only enrich my life but also complement and balance my rigorous focus on data analysis and project management.
